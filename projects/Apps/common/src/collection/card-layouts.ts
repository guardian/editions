/**
 * Denser layout than the default, that allows 2 or 3 articles on front card
 * (aka. front page) of a collection. The way the list is constructed is by
 * progressively increasing density, but avoiding repeating densities. (Ex. we
 * want to avoid 2 successive card with 4 articles each, to prevent a monotonous
 * layout.) Finally, we add a new card if we can't fit an additional article
 * anymore without getting a crowded and monotonous layout.
 *
 * We also make sure to progresively increase the number of the first card, but
 * never decrease it. This is because it'd otherwise be confusing for the
 * production/editioral team, where you might get better result adding 1 more
 * article in the collection, instead of breaking down a collection in smaller
 * ones.
