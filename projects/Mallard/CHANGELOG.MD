## ios: v5.3, android: v1.0.5

In this release the team have been working hard on the areas that have generated the most feedback from both our beta testers and AppStore users.

This version contains the following changes and improvements:
* You can now navigate straight to any section within the edition via the "Recent Editions" menu
* You now have access to up to 30 days worth of editions via the "Manage Editions" menu
* You may now restrict background downloading of the edition to when you have a WiFi connection
* Background downloading should be more reliable
* We fixed a problem when deleting all issues did not remove all issue data
* The offline banner should no longer show when you are actually online

Based on your feedback we are still working on a number of issues and features, including:
* Resolving reported issues with sign-in and subscriptions
* Increasing the number of stories visible on each screen
* Restoring full screen galleries
* Improving the look and feel of crosswords

We're grateful for all the beta feedback, and while the team read all of it we may not be able to respond directly to each message
