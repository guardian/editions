 * Attempts to login with apple OAuth

 *
 * Due to its dependency on `authWithDeepRedirect` it expects that auth to be completed
 * with a deep link back into the app. The `invariant` calls will throw if they fail.
 *
 * They have been written here with strings that currently are ok to show in the UI.
