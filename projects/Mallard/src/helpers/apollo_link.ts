/**
 * The `Link` is the interface Apollo uses to reach GraphQL servers. Since we

 * `Link` object. We *must* throw to prevent bad queries from carrying through.
 *
 * Apollo would try to use the `Link` if you have a query such as `{ foo }`
 * without the `@client` annotation. In our current use case, `@client` always
 * needs to be specified.
