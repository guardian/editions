	<h3>
		What makes the Guardian Editions app different to the Guardian Live app?
	</h3>
	<p>
		The Guardian Live app features all articles found on our website and you
		can follow live news coverage as it happens. The Editions app offers an
		alternative to live news coverage, providing a finite selection of
		articles put together by our editorial teams in the UK and Australia.
	</p>
	<h3>How do I purchase the Guardian Editions app?</h3>
	<p>
		The Guardian Editions app is available as part of a Digital
		subscription, or a print+digital subscription, details of which can be
		found on our website.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Guardian&rsquo;s complete digital subscription is built to fit with
		any routine. Two innovative apps, plus ad-free reading on
		theguardian.com, will give you an enhanced experience of our reporting
		across all your devices. You&rsquo;ll enjoy our coverage in a way that
		suits you - and you&rsquo;ll provide valuable support to The
		Guardian&rsquo;s independent, award-winning journalism.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>The Guardian Editions app</strong> - which includes the UK Daily
		edition, Australia Weekend and a special environment Edition
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Premium access to the Live app</strong> - breaking news, sport
		and opinion, updated throughout the day.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Ad-free</strong> - no adverts and no interruptions across all
		your devices.
	</p>
	<p>You can find out more about subscribing and pricing on our website.</p>
	<p>
		You can also access the Guardian Editions app on compatible iOS devices
		if you have an existing iTunes subscription to the Guardian old Daily
		Edition. Please note, the Guardian Editions app is no longer available
		to purchase as a stand-alone product in iTunes. If you have a Live app
		Premium tier subscription through Apple or Google Play, your
		subscription doesn't include access to Guardian Editions. For access to
		both the Guardian Live app and Guardian Editions app we recommend that
		you subscribe to our Guardian Digital subscription package. More details
		about the package can be found on the Guardian website.
	</p>

	<p>
		Tap on the Edition selector button on the top left hand corner of the
		home screen, this will open a new screen where you can select different
		Editions. ${editionsMenuButton()}
	</p>
	<h3>Can I access the Guardian Editions app on more than one device?</h3>
	<p>
		Yes, If you are a Digital subscriber, you can access the app on up to 10
		devices on either Apple or Android operating systems.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are an existing iTunes subscriber, you can access on up to 10
		iPad and iPhone devices.
	</p>
	<h3>What time is the latest edition available each day?</h3>
	<p>The UK Daily edition is typically available from 6am GMT each day.</p>
	<p>
		The Australia Weekend edition is typically available from 6am AEST on
		Saturday.
	</p>
	<h3>Can I use the Guardian Editions app when I&rsquo;m abroad?</h3>
	<p>
		Yes, we advise checking with your operator prior to using the app abroad
		as most monthly plans charge extra for data roaming while overseas. As
		this can often be expensive, either sync using Wi-Fi and read the
		edition offline or contact your service provider for details of how to
		purchase cut-price roaming tariffs.
	</p>
	<h3>How do I access crosswords?</h3>
	<p>
		The UK Daily features crosswords everyday and can always be found at the
		bottom of the home page.
	</p>
	<p>
		Australia Weekend features a crossword in every week&rsquo;s edition and
		can always be found at the bottom of the home page.
	</p>
	<h3>Can I access video in the Guardian Editions app?</h3>
	<p>
		Yes, the app gives you access to videos featured in the last 30 days of
		editions while your device is online. To listen to a video audio, your
		phone or tablet ring should be ON, not silent.
	</p>
	<h3>How do I change the font size?</h3>
	<p>
		Article text size can be adjusted within the accessibility settings on
		your device.
	</p>
	<h3>Is there a dark mode?</h3>
	<p>
		It's currently not available, but we might have it in the future if
		there's strong demand.
	</p>
	<h3>How do I share content?</h3>
	<p>
		Articles available for sharing have a share icon on the right hand side
		near the top of the article page.
	</p>
	<p>
		For technical reasons, currently, not all articles are available for
		sharing and therefore won&rsquo;t have a share icon. Articles are
		available for sharing if a web version of the article is published
		before the day&rsquo;s issue is published. There's also some print-only
		content only available on the Editions app and the printed newspaper,
		not the web.
	</p>
	<h3>Can I hide the weather ?</h3>
	<p>
		You can elect to show or hide the weather in the Settings page of the
		app.
	</p>
	<h3>Are there versions for regions outside of the UK and Australia?</h3>
	<p>
		More regionalised versions are something we intend to introduce. When a
		local version is available in your region, you will be notified in app
		or over email.
	</p>
	<h3>
		I used to read the Daily app, how is the new Editions app different?
	</h3>
	<p>
		You can still access the UK Daily edition within the Guardian Editions
		app. We have changed the name when we introduced the Australia Weekend
		edition in October 2020, to reflect the fact you can now access multiple
		regional editions as well as one-off special editions.
	</p>
	<h3>
		I have feedback on the Guardian Editions app, where should I send it?
	</h3>

		can contact us through the app by tapping on the yellow button in the
		top right corner ${burgerMenuSVG()}, then tap the cog icon
		${settingsCogSVG()} to open settings and select Help. You can also email
		Editions.feedback@theguardian.com.
