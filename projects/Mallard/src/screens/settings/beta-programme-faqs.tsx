    <h2>What is the Editions beta app?</h2>
    <p>
        Thank you for your interest in the Guardian Editions beta. The beta
        version of the Guardian Editions app (current Daily app) provides you
        access to new developments in the app and also the new Australia Weekend
        edition.
    </p>
    <p>
        By joining our beta programme, you&rsquo;ll be helping us deliver the
        best experience possible by providing early feedback and reporting any
        bugs that you may encounter in the app. We have a limited number of beta
        places and your help is invaluable and much appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note, if you currently access the Editions app with a
        subscription through Apple, you can not redeem your existing
        subscription within Testflight. Guardian Digital subscribers can access
        the beta app across both platforms - Android and iOS.
