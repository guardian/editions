    <h2><strong>How we collect personal data</strong></h2>
    <p>We collect personal data via :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                technology similar to cookies when you use mobile devices to
                access the content in the app;
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>email or when you contact us via our app</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why we use your personal data</strong></p>
    <p>
        We use personal data collected through our app for a number of purposes,
        including the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                To provide the services you sign up for, including accessing
                your Digital subscription. We also use the personal data for
                related internal administrative purposes – such as our
                accounting and records – and to make you aware of any changes to
                our services.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                To send marketing communications when we have your permission,
                or when permitted by law.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                To personalise our services (for example, so you can sign in),
                remembering your settings, recognising you when you sign in on
                different devices and tailoring our marketing communications
                based on what you read on our sites and apps.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                To carry out marketing analysis, for example, we look at what
                you have viewed on our apps. You can opt out from having your
                personal data used for marketing analysis by going into your
                theguardian.com account to the tab “Emails and marketing”.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                For statistical purposes such as analysing the performance of
                our apps and to understand how visitors use it.

        <li>

                For security and fraud prevention, and to ensure that our app is
                safe and secure and used in line with our
                <strong>gu.com/p/4vgfy</strong> terms of use.

    <p>
        <em><strong>Legal grounds for using your personal data</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only use your personal data where we have a legal ground to do
        so. We determine the legal grounds based on the purposes for which we
        have collected and used your personal data. In every case, the legal
        ground will be one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Consent: For example, where you have provided your consent to
                receive marketing emails from us on theguardian.com. You can
                withdraw your consent at any time. In the case of marketing
                emails you can withdraw your consent by clicking on the
                “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email or through your
                email preferences in the “emails and marketing” tab, when signed
                into your Guardian account.

                Our legitimate interests: Where it is necessary for us to
                understand our readers, promote our services and operate our
                sites and apps efficiently for the creation, publication and
                distribution of news, media and related journalistic content
                both online and in print form, globally. For example, we will
                rely on our legitimate interest when we analyse what content has
                been viewed on our sites and apps, so that we can understand how
                they are used. It is also in our legitimate interest to carry
                out marketing analysis to determine what products and services
                may be relevant to the interests of our readers. You can opt out
                from having your personal data used for marketing analysis in
                your account in the “emails and marketing” tab on the Guardian
                website.

                Performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps
                prior to entering into a contract with you): For example, where
                you have purchased a subscription from us and we need to use
                your contact details and payment information in order to process
                your order and deliver your subscription.

    <p><em>Adding to or combining the personal data you provide to us</em></p>
    <p>
        When you subscribe to our services, we may add to the personal data you
        give us by combining it with information shared with us by other trusted
        organisations. This includes, for example, information about the region
        that you are located in, so that we can show you the prices for
        subscriptions or other products in your local currency. We may also add
        information to improve the accuracy of your delivery address when we
        send out mail. We may also obtain information from partners whose offers
        we include in some of our marketing communications and we use this
        information to ensure that we do not send you irrelevant marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also use information on the content you have viewed on our sites and
        apps and your interaction with the content to add you to groups with
        similar interests and preferences, so that we can make our online
        advertising more relevant. Sometimes we use data about your interests or
        demographics that third parties have collected from you online to add to
        these groups. Please refer to our cookies policy for more information on
        how we use cookies <strong>gu.com/p/2j9cm</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Using children’s personal data</strong></h2>
    <p>
        We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under
        the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data about
        children under 13. Some of our services may have a higher age
        restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Security of your personal data</strong></h2>
    <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to
        protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against
        accidental loss, damage or destruction. You are responsible for choosing
        a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts
        of this app. You should keep this password confidential and you should
        choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not
        share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us.
        Unfortunately, sending information via the internet is not completely
        secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data once
        with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to
        our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Who we share your personal data with</strong></p>
    <p>
        We do not share your personal data with other people or organisations
        that are not directly linked to Guardian News &amp; Media Limited except
        under the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                We may share your data with other organisations that provide
                services on our behalf such as fraud prevention services,
                services that assist with tracking errors and defects in the
                app, as well as services that deal with online payments and
                other forms of payment processing, ie credit card transactions.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency,
                court, regulator, government authority or other organisation if
                we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory
                obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of
                anyone else.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                We may reveal your personal data to any other organisation that
                buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our
                assets and business. If this sale or transfer takes place, we
                will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the
                organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line
                with our privacy policy.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any organisations which access your data in the course of providing
        services on our behalf will be governed by strict contractual
        restrictions to make sure that they protect your data and keep to all
        data privacy laws that apply. We may also independently audit these
        service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will not share your personal data with anyone else for their own
        marketing purposes unless we have your permission to do this.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>International data transfers</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any
        country or territory where one or more of our Guardian group companies
        or service providers are based or have facilities. While other countries
        or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as
        those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data
        that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK or the European
        Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at
        least one of these safeguards:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
                been found to provide an adequate level of protection for
                personal data.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                We may also use specific approved contracts with our service
                providers that are based in countries outside the UK or the EEA.
                These contracts give your personal data the same protection it
                has in the UK .
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Where we use service providers in the United States, we may
                transfer personal data to them if they are part of the Privacy
                Shield scheme, which requires them to provide a similar level of
                protection of your personal data to what is required in the UK
                and the EEA.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you are located in the UK or EEA, you may contact us for a copy of
        the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your
        personal data outside the UK or EEA.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>How long we keep your personal data</strong></h2>
    <p>
        We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we
        need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out
        in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer
        your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep
        personal data while you are still using our product or services. We may
        also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for
        example, where you have bought a subscription. If we no longer need your
        data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details
        that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your
        personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that
        processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your
        personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing
        communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not
        send you any marketing in future.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>How we may contact you</strong></h2>
    <p><em>Service communications</em></p>
    <p>
        From time to time we may send you service emails, for example, telling
        you your subscription is coming to an end or thanking you when you
        contribute or place an order with us.
    </p>
    <p><em>Marketing communications and editorial newsletters</em></p>
    <p>
        While there is no online advertising on this app, we may send you
        materials we think may interest you, such as new Guardian offers and
        updates, if we have your permission. Depending on your marketing
        preferences, this may be by email, phone, SMS or post. You can manage
        your preferences through the tab “Emails and marketing” when you are
        signed in to your Guardian account through our website.
    </p>
    <p><em>Responding to your queries or complaints</em></p>
    <p>
        If you have raised a query or a complaint with us, we may contact you to
        answer your query or to resolve your complaint.

                If you would like to have a copy of the personal data we hold on
                you or if you think that we hold incorrect personal data about
                you, please write to the Data Protection Officer at Guardian
                News &amp; Media Limited, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1
                9GU or email dataprotection@theguardian.com. We will deal with
                requests for copies of your personal data or for correction of
                your personal data within one month. If your request is
                complicated or if you have made a large number of requests, it
                may take us longer. We will let you know if we need longer than
                one month to respond. You will not have to pay a fee to obtain a
                copy of your personal data (or to exercise any of the other
                rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request
                is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
