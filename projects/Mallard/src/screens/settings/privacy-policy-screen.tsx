We also ask for permission to access the storage on your mobile device, so that you can store content and read when offline.<br></p></li> <li><p>For the iOS version, we ask for permission to save pictures to your photo library, so that you can save pictures that you find in our articles on your mobile device.<br></p></li> </ul> <p><em>Legal grounds for using your personal data</em></p> <p>We will only use your personal data where we have a legal ground to do so. We determine the legal grounds based on the purposes for which we have collected and used your personal data. In every case, the legal ground will be one of the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>Consent: For example, where you have provided your consent to receive marketing emails from us. You can withdraw your consent at any time. In the case of marketing emails you can withdraw your consent by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email or through your email preferences in the “emails and marketing” tab, when signed into your Guardian account.<br></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Our legitimate interests: Where it is necessary for us to understand our readers, promote our services and operate our sites and apps efficiently for the creation, publication and distribution of news, media and related journalistic content both online and in print form, globally. For example, we will rely on our legitimate interest when we analyse what content has been viewed on our sites and apps, so that we can understand how they are used. It is also in our legitimate interest to carry out marketing analysis to determine what products and services may be relevant to the interests of our readers. You can opt out from having your personal data used for marketing analysis in your account in the “emails and marketing” tab.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you): For example, where you have purchased a subscription from us and we need to use your contact details and payment information in order to process your order and deliver your subscription.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Compliance with law: In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Updating your personal data and your profile page on our sites</em></p> <p>When you register for an account with theguardian.com, you have access to a profile page.

This includes, for example, information about the region that you are located in, so that we can show you the prices for subscriptions or other products in your local currency. We may also add information to improve the accuracy of your delivery address when we send out mail. We may also obtain information from partners whose offers we include in some of our marketing communications and we use this information to ensure that we do not send you irrelevant marketing.</p> <p>We also use information on the content you have viewed on our sites and apps and your interaction with the content to add you to groups with similar interests and preferences, so that we can make our online advertising more relevant. Sometimes we use data about your interests or demographics that third parties have collected from you online to add to these groups. Please refer to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies\">cookies policy</a> for more information on how we use cookies.<br></p> <p><em>Information shared by event partners<br></em></p> <p>When you register or book a ticket for a Guardian event organised by an event partner, your registration data may be shared with us by the event partner.<br></p> <h2><strong>Using children’s personal data</strong></h2> <p>We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data about children under 13. Some of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration.<br></p> <h2><strong>Security of your personal data</strong></h2> <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. You are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our sites or apps. You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us. Unfortunately, sending information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data once with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.<br></p> <p><strong>Who we share your personal data with<br></strong></p> <p>Depending on where you live, we may share your personal data with the Guardian group of companies currently based in the UK, US or Australia. For example, if you book an event held in Australia, at first we may hold your data on our systems in the UK and then we may share it with the Guardian in Australia for administration purposes.<br></p> <p>If you are going to one of our events hosted by an event partner, we may share your personal data with that partner for event administration purposes.<br></p> <p>Sometimes we may receive a letter, email or another form of communication from you that we consider to be significant to the history of the Guardian. We may decide to share this with the Guardian Archive run by the Guardian Foundation for historic and archiving purposes.<br></p> <p>We do not share your personal data with other people or organisations that are not directly linked to us except under the following circumstances:</p> <ul> <li><p>We may share your data with other organisations that provide services on our behalf such as dealing with online payments and other forms of payment processing, ie credit card transactions and preventing fraud.<br></p></li> <li><p>We may also share your data with our advertising partners, as set out in the section about Online Advertising below.<br></p></li> <li><p>We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority or other organisation if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else.<br></p></li> <li><p>We may reveal your personal data to any other organisation that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business. If this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.<br></p></li> </ul> <p>Any organisations which access your data in the course of providing services on our behalf will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your data and keep to all data privacy laws that apply. We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.<br></p> <p>We will not share your personal data with anyone else for their own marketing purposes unless we have your permission to do this.<br></p> <p>Some of our webpages use social plug-ins from other organisations (such as the “Facebook Recommend” function, Twitter’s retweet function, Google+ function). These other organisations may receive and use personal data about your visit to our sites or apps. If you browse our site or view content on our apps, information they collect may be connected to your account on their site. For more information on how these organisations use personal data, please read their privacy policies.<br></p> <h2>International data transfers</h2> <p>Data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where one or more of our Guardian group companies or service providers are based or have facilities. While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.<br></p> <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:</p> <ul> <li><p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.<br></p></li> <li><p>We may also use specific approved contracts with our service providers that are based in countries outside the EEA. These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the EEA .<br></p></li> <li><p>Where we use service providers in the United States, we may transfer personal data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield scheme, which requires them to provide a similar level of protection of your personal data to what is required in the EEA.<br></p></li> </ul> <p>If you are located in the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the EEA.<br></p> <h2>How long we keep your personal data</h2> <p>We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we need you personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep personal data while you are still using our product or services. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription. If we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing in future.<br></p> <h2>How we may contact you</h2> <p><em>Service communications<br></em></p> <p>From time to time we may send you service emails, for example, telling you your subscription is coming to an end or thanking you when you contribute or place an order with us.</p> <p><em>Marketing communications and editorial newsletters<br></em></p> <p>If we have your permission, we may send you materials we think may interest you, such as new Guardian offers and updates. Depending on your marketing preferences, this may be by email, phone, SMS or post.</p> <p>We offer a range of editorial newsletters. You can manage your subscription to these emails through your profile page when you are signed in to your Guardian account.<br></p> <p>You can decide not to receive these emails at any time and will be able to “unsubscribe” directly by clicking a link in the email or through your email preferences in the tab “Emails and marketing” when you are signed in to your Guardian account.<br></p> <p><em>Market research<br></em></p> <p>Sometimes we may contact you for market research purposes, for example about a survey. You can opt out from being contacted in this way by signing into your Guardian account and going to the tab “Emails and marketing”.</p> <p><em>Responding to your queries or complaints<br></em></p> <p>If you have raised a query or a complaint with us, we may contact you to answer your query or to resolve your complaint.</p> <h2>Cookies and similar technology</h2> <p>When you visit our sites or when you use our apps, we may collect personal data from you automatically using cookies or similar technology. A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device that allows us to recognise and remember you.<br></p> <p>This privacy policy includes our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies\">cookie policy</a>, where you can find details of our key advertising partners.<br></p> <h2>Online advertising</h2> <p>Advertising on our sites that is based on cookies and similar technology<br></p> <p>We use personalised online advertising on our sites. This allows us to deliver more relevant advertising to people who visit theguardian.com. It works by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our sites and apps. It then shows you adverts which we believe may interest you.<br></p> <p>Since the publication of the very first edition of the Manchester Guardian on 5 May 1821, our journalism has been funded in part by advertising. Our editorial content is not influenced by the advertising we display and our journalists are free to, and often do, challenge the activities of companies and organisations that advertise and sponsor content that appears in Guardian sites and publications.<br></p> <p>When you browse our sites or use our apps, some of the cookies and similar technology we place on your device are advertising cookies, so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in. We can then display advertising on your browser based on these interests. For instance if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles, we may show you more advertisements for food and drink.<br></p> <p>We do not collect or use information such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number for personalised online advertising.<br></p> <p>We may also share online data collected through cookies and similar technology with our advertising partners. This means that when you are on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing patterns on theguardian.com. We may also show you advertising on theguardian.com website based on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our advertising partners.<br></p> <p>Online retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you advertising based on your browsing patterns and interactions with a site away from our sites.<br></p> <p>For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing adverts from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products you were browsing. This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.<br></p> <h2>Advertising that we place on our site or on other sites</h2> <p>We also use personalised online advertising to promote our own products and services. This means that you may see advertising for our products and services on our sites (and our other platforms, such as Guardian Jobs) and when you are on other, third party websites, including social media platforms.<br></p> <h2>Your rights with regard to the personal data that we hold about you</h2> <p>You can contact us with regard to the following rights in relation to your personal data:</p> <ul> <li><p>If you would like to have a copy of the personal data we hold on you or if you think that we hold incorrect personal data about you, please write to the Data Protection Officer at Guardian News &amp; Media Limited, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email <a href=\"mailto:dataprotection@theguardian.com\">dataprotection@theguardian.com</a>. We will deal with requests for copies of your personal data or for correction of your personal data within one month. If your request is complicated or if you have made a large number of requests, it may take us longer. We will let you know if we need longer than one month to respond. You will not have to pay a fee to obtain a copy of your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.<br></p></li> <li><p>Where you have provided us with consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw this at any time.<br></p></li> <li><p>Where applicable, you may also have a right to receive a machine-readable copy of your personal data.<br></p></li> <li><p>You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data or restrict how it is used. There may be exceptions to the right to erasure for specific legal reasons which, if applicable, we will set out for you in response to your request. Where applicable, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data for certain purposes.<br></p></li> <li><p>If you do not want us to use your personal data for marketing analysis, you can change your settings in the “Emails and marketing” tab of your Guardian account.<br></p></li> </ul> <p>If you want to make any of these requests, please contact <a href=\"mailto:dataprotection@theguardian.com\">dataprotection@theguardian.com</a>.<br></p> <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity.</p> <h2>Your California privacy rights</h2> <p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you live in California and your business relationship with us is mainly for personal, family or household purposes, you may ask us about the information we release to other organisations for their marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:dataprotection@theguardian.com\">dataprotection@theguardian.com</a> with “Request for California privacy information”in the subject line. You may make this type of request once every calendar year. We will email you a list of categories of personal data we revealed to other organisations for their marketing purposes in the last calendar year, along with their names and addresses. Not all personal data shared in this way is covered by Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code.<br></p> <h2>Contact us for information about how we use your personal data</h2> <p>If you have any questions about how we use your personal data or if you have a concern about how your personal data is used, please contact the Data Protection Officer at Guardian News &amp; Media Limited, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
