 * look for the resolver `Query.foo` (`Query` is just the "namespace" where
 * all queries start).
 *  *
 * Resolvers are functions, which can be asynchonous. They can gather data from
 * local storage (ex. settings), from local APIs (ex. permissions, geolocation),
 * from remote APIs (ex. REST API).
 *
 * Once a resolver returns a value, Apollo will refresh automatically
 * any component that was requiring this in a query via the `useQuery` function.
