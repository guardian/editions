     * all queries start).

     * Resolvers are functions, which can be asynchonous. They can gather data from
     * local storage (ex. settings), from local APIs (ex. permissions, geolocation),
     * from remote APIs (ex. REST API).
     *
     * Once a resolver returns a value, Apollo will refresh automatically
     * any component that was requiring this in a query via the `useQuery` function.
