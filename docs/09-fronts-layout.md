# Editions Layout/Glossary

This doc is an attempt to make life easier for the next person to make layout changes to the fronts of the editions app. It is up to date as of July 2020, but will likely eventually go stale.

It should also be a useful reference point for non-developers looking to see what the current state of play is in the app.

## Fronts

This is a front - it's the whole thing from left to right. The name of the front is always visible. A subtitle may also be visible depending what `Collection` is visible.

## Collections

A collection is a subsection within a Front. It might have it's own `subtitle` - see below.

## Cards

Cards may have from 1 to 5 stories on them. 'Cover Cards' contain an image covering the full card, and are made in the [editions card builder](https://github.com/guardian/editions-card-builder)

## Layout/Sizing

### Images

Image sizes are controlled
